            The computer generates a random number with four different digits. At each turn the player enters a four-digit number.
            Sheep means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd, but not on the same position.
            Ram means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd and it is on the same position.
            The game continues until the player guesses the number abcd (the player have 4 rams).
